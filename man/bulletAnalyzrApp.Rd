\usage{
bulletAnalyzrApp(
  run_interactive = TRUE,
  sample_m = 10,
  save_diagnostics = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{run_interactive}{TRUE allows the user to adjust the crosscut and groove
locations. FALSE uses the crosscut and grooves automatically chosen by the
app.}

\item{sample_m}{An integer value by which to downsample the x3p scan for
display. High-resolution scans that are 15+ MB require more memory and
might crash the app unless down-sampled. On the other hand,
lower-resolution scans can appear too smooth if too much down-sampling is
performed. The default of sample_m = 10 was optimized for 15+ MB scans.
Downsampling is only performed on the displayed scans. All computations use
the original resolution.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to 'onStart', 'options', 'uiPattern', or
'enableBookmarking' of 'shiny::shinyApp'}

\item{save_diagnositcs}{TRUE saves the resolution, features, bullet scores,
and bulldata to file when they are first calculated. They are saved in RDS
files in the temporary directory. FALSE does not save these files.}
